# ibm_pi_image

Import the details of an existing IBM Power Virtual Server Cloud image as a read-only data source. For more information, about IBM power virtual server cloud, see [getting started with IBM Power Systems Virtual Servers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-getting-started).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "ibm_pi_image" "ds_image" {
  pi_cloud_instance_id = "49fba6c9-23f8-40bc-9899-aca322ee7d5b"
  pi_image_id          = "7f8e2a9d-3b4c-4e4f-8e8d-f7e7e1e23456"
}
```

### Notes

- Please find [supported Regions](https://cloud.ibm.com/apidocs/power-cloud#endpoint) for endpoints.
- If a Power cloud instance is provisioned at `lon04`, The provider level attributes should be as follows:
  - `region` - `lon`
  - `zone` - `lon04`
  
Example usage:

  ```terraform
    provider "ibm" {
      region    =   "lon"
      zone      =   "lon04"
    }
  ```
